# Backpacker Buddy App

BACKPACKER BUDDY App is my current Android project where solo travelers can connect with one another and plan a solo traveling trip together. </b>
The user can sign up, create a personalized profile, post their traveling itineraries, see who's around them, who's recently online, who's going to be in which country at which date, chat and manage their account. </b>

This personal project was inspired by my solo trip around Eastern Europe in June of 2016. :)

# Some Noteable Tools Used </b>
* MySQL for database </b>
* Firebase Cloud Messaging for chat </b>
* Firebase Cloud Messaging for new message notification </b>
* Google location service API </b>
* Retrofit for REST client </b>
* Picasso for image loading </b>
* ButterKnife for view injection </b>
