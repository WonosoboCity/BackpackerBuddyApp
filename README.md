# Backpacker Buddy App

BACKPACKER BUDDY App is my current Android project where solo travelers can connect with one another and plan a solo traveling trip together. </b>
The user can sign up, create a personalized profile, post their traveling itineraries, see who's around them, who's recently online, who's going to be in which country at which date, chat and manage their account. </b>

This personal project was inspired by my solo trip around Eastern Europe in June of 2016. :)
